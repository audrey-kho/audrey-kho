## 👋 Hi there, I'm Audrey!

### I am passionate about web development 👩‍💻, visual design 🎨, and application security 🔐.

Last summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/), where I built a full-stack task automation tool with the Adobe Express team. I also previously interned at [Braze](https://www.braze.com/) and [Ionic](https://ionic.io/). 

I'm actively seeking 2024 new grad SWE or UX Engineer opportunities 🌟
