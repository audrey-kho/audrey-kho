## 👋 Hi there, I'm Audrey!

### I am passionate about full-stack web development 👩‍💻, visual design 🎨, and application security 🔐.

This summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) <img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/A/adobe-experience-cloud-cc-logo-68AF508F01-seeklogo.com.png" alt="Adobe logo" width=16>, where I built a full-stack PTO automation tool under the Adobe Express team. I also previously interned at [Braze](https://www.braze.com/) <img src="https://companieslogo.com/img/orig/BRZE.D-8b6c9828.png?t=1636485392" alt="Braze logo" width=15> and [Ionic](https://ionic.io/) <img src="https://images.prismic.io/ionicframeworkcom/66cfdbef-e59d-463a-8e24-12cb233e9d97_ionic+logo+blue.png?auto=compress,format" alt="Ionic logo" width=15>.
