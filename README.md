## 👋 Hi there, I'm Audrey!

### I am passionate about full-stack web development 👩‍💻, visual design 🎨, and application security 🔐.

This summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/), where I built a full-stack internal tool for team productivity. I also previously interned at [Braze](https://www.braze.com/) and [Ionic](https://ionic.io/). Read more about me and my past work at [audrey-kho.github.io/](https://audrey-kho.github.io/).

I am actively seeking 2024 new grad SWE opportunities 🌟
